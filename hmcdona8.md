I am Hezekiah McDonald, a junior computer science student from chattanooga.
I became interested in computer science from experimenting with game engines
while in middle school. I would be interested in projects that have to do with
game development and web development because of my passion and experience making 
games and my recognition of the power of websites as a means of spreading communication.
