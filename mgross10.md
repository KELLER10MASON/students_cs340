I am Maddie Gross and I am a Junior Computer Science major here at the University of Tennessee. I spent a semester co-oping for DENSO in Maryville TN where I learned a lot about web development and full-stack programming, which I really enjoy doing. I still work there part-time now and really love it. I would like to learn more about database management and SQL so that I can use it more at work and to further my knowledge about it.
