Hii! My name is Eric Yang, and I'm a junior studying computer science! These college courses have
been my only exposure to the computer science curriculum, and I also accidentally wiped all
my files over the years of my study after uninstalling Ubuntu a month ago, so if I look
detached in class, it's because of that :< 

I would love to participate in a fun class project! For example, things like creating an
interactive "world map" application that allows users to make their own world for their stories,
or an animation application where users can animate and draw!
