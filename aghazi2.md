My name is Ahmed Ghazi and I am majoring in computer science and minoring in machine learning. I
am excited to learn about working with a team because I have an internship this Summer and I will need
to work with a team. A project that I would prefer to work on would be something that is practical to me 
and something that I can use frequently. An example would be a dashboard application for a game i'm playing or 
a calendar application.
