I am Kevin Lam, a junior in Computer Science minoring in machine learning. I am interested in learning different things in CS like machine learning, game dev, web dev, and app dev. Currently, I am interested on working with some friends on a D&D match finder app/website to allow users to post their playing sessions and/or look for playing sessions near them.
