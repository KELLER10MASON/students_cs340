My name is Lena Young and I am a Junior majoring in CS. I am interested specifically in cybersecurity and software engineering, 
but for this project I would like to focus on developing my interface skills. I am interested in creating some type of 
application where I can develop front end skills and apply them to a meaningful cause.
