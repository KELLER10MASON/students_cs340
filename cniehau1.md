Hi, I'm Christian Niehaus. I've been coding for a little over 8 years now, and I have worked an internship at a local company called HammrTech that was aquired just before I left. Outside of programming, I like Minecraft and Rubik's cubes. For those interested, my 3x3 average is ~22 seconds right now, but during the one competition that I went to, I managed a 19 second Ao5.
For the class project, I want to work on something multiplayer game related, but I have no idea what that would be exactly yet.
