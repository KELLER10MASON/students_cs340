I am Nic Dawson and I'm interested in working on systems that would contribute to a
robotics-oriented project. I participated in a FIRST Robotics team while I was in high school and
watching our programming control a physical system sold on computer science. I'd love to
continue this passion through this class by working on a program or subsystem that gathers data
from the world (ie terrain mapping, computer vision) or controls a mechanical output
(ie pathfinding, inverse kinematics, etc).
