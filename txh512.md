I am Braeden Watkins and I grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee. I have lived here all of my life and always wanted to attend UTK. Now I am here as a senior majoring in Computer Science. I want to work on a class project that focuses on creating something that can be widely used by having features such as cross-platform. I want my project to be something that can assist users by providing statistics that might be beneficial. I am not sure exactly what I would like to do just yet but I am thinking maybe some sort of application that has both frontend and backend components.
